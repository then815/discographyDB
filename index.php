            <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">Jack Johnson is a jack-of-all-trades.  His job titles have included professional surfer, producer, film-maker, actor, philanthropist, and most famously, singer-songwriter.  His mixture of acoustic folk, soft-rock, and hip-hop influenced lyric construction gives him a unique style all his own.  Jack grew up in Oahu, Hawaii as the youngest of 3 boys.  Like most boys, he wanted to follow in the foot steps of his father,well-known professional surfer Jeff Johnson.  At 17 years old Jack achieved that dream and became the youngest invited surfer to make the finals at the Pipeine Masters in Oahu.  Unfortunately an injury derailed his career one week later.<br/>  Jack began playing guitar at the age of 8 and started writting songs at the age of 12 however his passion for music didn't reach its peak until he joined a band playing rhythm guitar in college.  Jack has since released 6 studio albums, 5 of which have been released on his Brushfire Records label (formerly Moonshine Conspiracy), as well as the soundtrack for the 2006 movie Curious George.  Jack has also been a part of 6 films and is credited as everything from actor to director.  In addition to his music and film career Jack has also started the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation with his wife Kim.  The foundation is non-profit organizations that focuses on environmental, arts and music education.</p>
